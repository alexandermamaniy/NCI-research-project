A detailed discussion of the findings from the N experiments / case studies. Note that this discussion will have a lot more detail than the discussion in the following section (Conclusion). You should criticize the experiment(s), and be honest about whether your design was good enough. Suggest any modifications and improvements that could be made to the design to improve the results. You should always put your findings into the context of the previous research that you found during your literature review
