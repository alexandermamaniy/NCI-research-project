\begin{abstract}
The increasing deployment of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices has raised a serious problem about the lack of scalable and adaptable system-level access control in environments with limited resources. Traditional Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems like SELinux and AppArmor are often either too static or heavyweight for embedded Linux platforms. This research proposes a lightweight, programmable MAC framework using Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and Linux Security Modules (LSM) hooks to enforce security policies  within the Linux kernel.  This approach will support policy updates, and low latency; the system aims to overcome existing MAC models like AppArmor and SELinux. It follows a design science methodology and will be implemented and evaluated on a physical environment (Raspberry Pi). The expected contribution is a reference framework in-kernel access control in modern IoT systems.
